# obsidian-code-snippets
A collection of Obsidian code snippets that I use in my Obsidian vault. Each set of notes is contained in its own directory and outlined below:

## Random Evergreen Note
- Displays 5 random notes that are marked as #evergreen
- There are 2 files:
	- 1 was the initial code snippet but this would sometimes include the same note twice
	- 2 is an updated version which should not include duplicate notes
- This article will show you how it works: [My Obsidian Daily Note Template 2022](https://www.mishacreatrix.com/obsidian-daily-note-2022)
